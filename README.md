1. Setup a virtual environment.
2. Fork the repository for [Django Task 05](https://github.com/JoinCODED/task_05) in JoinCODEDâ€™s Github and Clone it.
3. Install the packages from the requirements file.
4. The list view function has been partially written for you. Provide the dictionary key `restaurants` with the list of **all** `Restaurant` objects.
5. Render the list of `Restaurant` objects to the HTML file provided. In the list view, you'll want to display minimum data (restaurant name and description).
6. The detail view function has been partially written for you. Provide the dictionary key `restaurant` with the specific `Restaurant` object using the `id`.
7. Render the `Restaurant` object to the HTML file provided. In the detail view, you'll want to display all data.
8. Adjust the URLs so that they'll correctly call the views.
9. Using the `URL tag`, **hyperlink** the restaurant objects in the **list** page, so that when a user clicks on a restaurant it takes the user to the detail page.
10. Pass the tests.
